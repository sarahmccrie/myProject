            <p class="abouttext">Hello! My name is Sarah McCrie and I am a first year Software Development and Network Engineering student at Sheridan College.</p>
            <h2 class="aboutsubtitle">How it Started:</h2>
            <p class="abouttext">In 2016, I graduated from Sheridan's Art Fundamentals Program before deciding to persue another career path. Then, in 2020, I graduated from Sheridan's Veterinary Technician Program, completed the <a class="contextlinks" href="https://www.aavsb.org/vtne-overview/">Veterinary Technician National Exam (VTNE)</a> and received my license as a <a class="contextlinks" href="https://oavt.org/about/what-is-an-rvt/">Registered Veterinary Technician (RVT)</a> from the <a class="contextlinks" href="https://oavt.org/about/">Ontario Association of Veterinary Technicians (OAVT)</a>. For 2 years, I worked full time as an RVT for a wonderful clinic before ultimately deciding to return to school for software development. I am now enrolled in school full time and am still working part time as an RVT.</p>
            <p class="abouttext">With my love for animals and my desire to continue improving my art skills, I began painting pet portraits for my friends and family. With enough practice, I am now happy to offer custom portraits to you as well! <a class="contextlinks" href="art.php">Come take a look...</a></p>

            <p class="aboutimagecaption"> This is Maisie, my 150lbs St. Bernard just over 5 years ago. She wasn't my first furry-love, and she won't be my last. Her little sister, my heart-dog, <a class="junipercursor" href="#">Juniper</a>, is a 145lbs Leonberger, and my kitty, <a class="freddiecursor" href="#">Freddie</a>, is a 12 month old Maine Coon.</p>
